There are six popular process scheduling algorithms which are used very often âˆ’

## First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) Scheduling
## Shortest-Job-Next (SJN) Scheduling
## Priority Scheduling
## Shortest Remaining Time
## Round Robin(RR) Scheduling
## Memory Allocation-First Fit,Best Fit and Worst Fit

These algorithms are either non-preemptive or preemptive. Non-preemptive algorithms are designed so that once a process enters the running state, it cannot be preempted until it completes its allotted time, whereas the preemptive scheduling is based on priority where a scheduler may preempt a low priority running process anytime when a high priority process enters into a ready state.
