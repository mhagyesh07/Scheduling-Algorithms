# Operating System-

There are six popular process scheduling algorithms which are used very often âˆ’

## First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) Scheduling
## Shortest-Job-First (SJF) Scheduling  (including Preemptive and Non-Preemptive)
## Priority Scheduling (including Preemptive and Non-Preemptive)
## Round Robin(RR) Scheduling
## Multi-Level Queue Scheduling (MLQ) 

These algorithms are either non-preemptive or preemptive. Non-preemptive algorithms are designed so that once a process enters the running state, it cannot be preempted until it completes its allotted time, whereas the preemptive scheduling is based on priority where a scheduler may preempt a low priority running process anytime when a high priority process enters into a ready state.
